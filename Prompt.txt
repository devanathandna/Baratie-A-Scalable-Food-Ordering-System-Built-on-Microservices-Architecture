Change the whole format
for user Registration 
get the input such as Name,Phone no,email,address,city,password
and store it in the database
for admin, get the details such as name, password 
in admin dashboard , three things are present
1) Add restaurent
that contains name,address,Array of Food that contains foodname,quantity, prices
and City(city is important)
2) Add products
in add product, list the restaurents and add details like foodname,quantity,prices

3) Delivery person
this contains name,phone no,city,charge amount

in user dashboard, user can view restaurents along with their food items details and they can add it in cart and place order
when they hit place order, they redirect to payment page there is a bill that contains total amount along with what foods and delivery charge 
below that they can choose they method of payment such as gpay, phonepay,card etc
After payment, the bill is generated as username, gmail,phoneno,timestamp but time and date, restaurent name, food name, quantity, price, delivery charge, total amount, payment method
and it is sent in neat format as gmail as
email_address = "bb1.deavanathan.s@gmail.com"
password = "ipwm okbq ryso xyjc"
toaddr = "dnathan781@gmail.com"


Now here's the main concern
Use builder pattern for the bill

Strategy pattern for payment
